Supermeowkat is designed to bring together liberals and proliferate their voices in every publicly available space.

It seeks to disrupt hegemony. It wants to redistribute attention from the USA's global stranglehold on culture and and thereby (hopefully) divert income to the rest of the world, with special concern for the Global South.

It wants to reduce the puritanical mores of the USA foisted upon the rest of the world, and to make irrelevant the laws and cultures created by former colonial oppressors.

It wants to raise the voices of the diverse peoples of our world, so that we may know their joy, their anger, their lives.

It wants to figure out how to do this in a world that actively refuses to recognise that the simple joys of everyday life in the first world depends so much on exploitation in the third.

It's not always consistent in all that it desires. It is itself a voice in the making.

It's one part research, one part art, one part resistance, and many parts hope.
