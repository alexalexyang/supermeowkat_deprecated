## Marketing literature review

[Launch Lessons: How Tinder, Reddit, Airbnb, Etsy and Uber got their first users](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/growth-hacking-lessons-from-the-big-guys-daebb2c791d2/)

All of these got lots of money for pre-launch marketing. So, not for me.

## Marketing Options

This section lays out some options for marketing. Where the commissioning of assets and art is concerned, I would like to commission artists from the Global South and request artworks that reference the diverse societies of that world.

### Video

Fancy video explaining what the app does.

### Twitter

So boring. But it's the only thing I've time for right now.

### Paid ads on Twitter and Facebook

Gotta try these. Also paid ads elsewhere. I think the data might be cool to have. Like, how much investment leads to how much conversion.

We know Facebook lies and cannot be trusted one bit. But do its ads still make a difference? Or are they a complete waste of money?

### Others

Post to different networks? Press releases?

### Commission web assets

Commission artists and designers to create icons, backgrounds, and other visuals for the look of the app. Ask artists for cross-posts.

### Commission swag

Commission artists and designers to produce plushies, posters, and other things that can be sold or given to users. Ask artists for cross-posts.

### Cute offensive

Full frontal cute offensive weaponising techniques pioneered by Hello Kitty, Keroppi, and their ilk.

## Asset/Artwork guidelines

These are guidelines, not rules. And my sense of the app's aesthetics is nascent. Let's see how things evolve.

- Nudity is ok.

- Depicting non-heterosexual relations is ok.

- Prefer subtle over overt.

- Less angst, more hope. Where there's little hope, prefer dignity and contemplation. Where there's anger, sometimes it's best to let it free. We'll see.

- No vulgarities in text or visuals. Although, I have some leeway for harsh themes.
