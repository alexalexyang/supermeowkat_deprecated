# Manifesto

## Why

Because I would like people who make things to be transparent about their convictions so that those who don't like them can choose not to use their things.

(Notwithstanding that consent becomes a sadistic joke when the network effect forces us to use apps we don't like.)

## Intentions of this app/site

I want to play with the data you give me and become a data baron.

## Select beliefs

American exceptionalism must end.

China must close down its concentration camps and free all Uighurs at once.

Thumbs up for the Milk Tea Alliance. End lese majeste in Thailand. End the military coup in Myanmar.

The idea of the nation is annoying and people should learn not to be so proud about something as arbitrary as the country of their birth.

There is no such thing as "Asian values". Democracy and human rights are universal values, not exclusively "western" ones. Looking at you, Singapore.

What else... Let me think.

Monogamy is not the only valid form of relationships. Polyamory is an equally valid form. There are others.

Support gender equality, the disabled, refugees, sex workers, neurodiversity, etc.

Bitcoin is a danger to our climate.

Food and language purists can go to hell.
