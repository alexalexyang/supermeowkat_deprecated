# Misc ideas to integrate

Supermeowkat is at heart a gramscian device that lives in the liminal space between mainstream popularity and sociopolitical niche. It's designed to bring together liberals and proliferate their voices in every publicly available space.

Supermeowkat inhabits the liminal space between popularity and provocation. The affordance of that space allows it to welcome both those who agree with it and some who don't.

Slowly get to know people, paced-out.

## Build the tools we need

The social networking space is dominated by apps that lean to a US-inflected flavour of norms. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Tinder, etc, share those norms, which tend towards the conservative. They've brought together, emboldened, and grown a network that shares in their image. They continue to build tools that perpetuate their politics. (Maybe description of how this discourse empowers people?) Where are the apps that practise more liberal politics?

Surely, there are some. For instance, the fediverse that includes Mastadon and Diaspora. I haven't had much success in those networks.

Another example is Lex, and app for queers. Scrolling through this app, I realised there are a lot of queer experience I've never had before, because I'm not queer. The sheer excitement and joy of someone transitioning for the first time, for instance, is entirely foreign to me. But the community understands that. Where there's pain the community provides support. Where there is joy, they share in it. A few posts have described this space as "cosy". Some have also said they love it because it's where they're understood.

This is the kind of space that we should continue iterating on. So that those of use within the liberal milieu may enjoy broader cosy and robust relationships. For Supermeowkat, this means especially within a physical proximity.

Politics need not be fraught. For our specific purpose at least, we can bring people together via nice things, like art, music, film, books, and food. People bond over these things. But before they can bond, they have to get together. Supermeowkat aims to do that.
