# The censorship question

Censorship or content moderation? I'm not calling it "content moderation". It's censorship.

Social networks have been criticised for censorship. The range of censored themes is probably broad. However, the two that immediately concern me are: political and sexual.

# Themes

## Theme 1: Politics

Social networks have scrubbed their platforms of posts concerning the oppression of marginalised peoples. The latest instance:

[Palestinians criticise social media censorship over Sheikh Jarrah](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/7/palestinians-criticise-social-media-censorship-over-sheikh-jarrah), 7 May 2021:

> The complicity between Israel and social media companies in regulating and censoring Palestinian content and accounts is well documented. Following a visit by a Facebook delegation in 2016, Israel’s justice minister at the time stated that Facebook, Google and YouTube were “complying with up to 95 percent of Israeli requests to delete content” – almost all of it Palestinian.
>
> Palestinians have also highlighted in addition to cracking down on freedom of expression, the acquiescence of these social media companies to Israeli government requests of revealing users’ data have led to the arrests of hundreds of Palestinians in the past several years, mainly for their posts on Facebook. In contrast, Israelis do not face the same treatment.
>
> 7amleh, the Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, published a study in 2017 that found every 46 seconds Israelis post a racist or inciting comment against Palestinians and Arabs. Yet there has been little action taken against these accounts.

## Theme 2: Sexuality

Social networks' prudishness stem from US puritanism. But it's also more than simply nipping nipples from Instagram. Sexuality provides excuses for power grabs by too-big-to-fail tech companies. The latest:

[Apple is using Itch.io’s ‘offensive and sexualized’ games as a cudgel against Epic](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5), 7 May 2021:

Vignette 1:

> Apple tried to turn Itch.io into a liability — by telling Epic Games Store general manager Steven Allison about “so-called adult games” that were “so offensive we cannot speak about them here.”

Vignette 2:

> Apple is notoriously wary of sexual or even debatably offensive content in its App Store. Until mid-2016, it told game developers that “if you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical app.”

## Censorship: necessary?

Here's one that seems a straightforward candidate for deletion:

Vignette 1 from [The Trauma Floor](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona), 25 Feb 2019:

> The video depicts a man being murdered. Someone is stabbing him, dozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life. Chloe’s job is to tell the room whether this post should be removed. She knows that section 13 of the Facebook community standards prohibits videos that depict the murder of one or more people.

How about if journalists or activists post photos of those slaughtered by political oppressors? Such as the bloodied and dead in Myanmar right now, or Syrians, West Papuans, and others?

These might seem inconsistent in logic but they do indicate what kind of people decide policy:

Vignette 2 from [The Trauma Floor](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona), 25 Feb 2019:

> A post calling someone “my favorite n-----” is allowed to stay up, because under the policy it is considered “explicitly positive content.”
>
> “Autistic people should be sterilized” seems offensive to him, but it stays up as well. Autism is not a “protected characteristic” the way race and gender are, and so it doesn’t violate the policy. (“Men should be sterilized” would be taken down.)

The big question remains: what should be censored and what not?

### Offense in context

What's offensive to us in one context may well be acceptable in another. Aside from their puritan origins, social networks are entertainment spaces. Within this context, only polite, clean, wholesome, "family-friendly", and wholly uncontroversial attitudes are permitted.

This is with good reason. If stress levels spike enough, people won't use the platform anymore, just like people stop following the news. Social networks are designed for that dopamine hit. They have a deeply vested interest to keep things uncontroversial.

### One's meat is another's poison

Deciding to keep things uncontroversial is the easy part. The next part, also pretty easy, is to decide which groups to offend and which not to, since what we find offensive another might find entirely palatable.

In this case, social networks defer to US mores. That is, as it is determined by a predominantly conservative privileged male white circle.

## Legalities

What happens if a social network wants to be inclusive of sexualities? Skipping some nuances, here's a straightforward question: what if we allow nudes?

Some more specific questions:

- Does a company need to apply for some special permissions/license for this?
- Would it be classed as porn? Can a company avoid this sort of categorisation?
- Will the company be barred from countries that do not agree with its stance?
- If I based my company in Sweden, how many of these issues are sidestepped? What other complications might there be?

Research later: onlyfans.

## Community censorship

We can create tools for the community to police itself. For instance, a naive tool would be like this: a post is automatically deleted if a post gets more than 5 dislikes. To take it a bit further: a user is automatically banned if at least 5 of their posts are tagged for deletion.

Two points of concern:

- Do we trust the community to make the right choices? I wouldn't. I studied and lived in the arts. A lot of what we do don't seem normal to a lot of society. We don't even agree with each other on a lot of things, both major and minor. Who gets to decide on what consensus looks like and, how to build towards it?

- Without oversight, this can be abused. Oversight means hiring people to do it. Will users pay enough for this to be possible?

## Summary

Important questions:

- what should be censored and what not?
- the whole Legalities section
- the two points of concern in the Community censorship section
